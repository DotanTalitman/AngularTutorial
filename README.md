# AngularTutorial
Angular 2-4 tutorial step by step.

### This tutorial will be from zero ,we will walk step by step from scratch!!

## Let's start 
First,we will use the VSCode  editor , but fell free to use any code editor or IDE that you preferd.
<br>
I opened a new directory and and named it "angular4project"

<br>
As I mentioned , this tutorial will guide you from zero , you will not download or clone some boilerplate or any other pre made code ,so you wiil be able to realy understand the basic concepts and the idea behind angular.
<br>
# NPM

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.<br>
npm is short for Node Package Manager and it have two major roles:
1. it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.
2. it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

### We will use npm alot and actually this is a very common tool  that developers use in everyday code!
In order to use npm you must install node.js on your computer: 
<br>
https://nodejs.org/en/ 
<br>
You can learn about node js and npm in many places over the internet like here for example :
<br>
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
<br>
##### For developing angular applications you will not need to understand node.js  so don't worry, just install it on your computer so you be able to use npm.
<br>
For now we will use npm only for downloading the libraries(packages)  that we need for our project.
<br>
Later we will use another powerful tools of npm !
<br>

## Dependencies
Dependencies are essential js packages that we need to have for running our angular application.
There are two kinds of dependencies:
##### Dependencies and devDevpendencies(we will talk later about third kind of dependency called peerDependencies)
If you familiar with angularjs (angular 1.x) you probably knows that all you need is to put in your project the angularjs library and that it! maby you will need the ngRoute library but you dont have to.. with Angular (2..4..)  it is a different story.
In order to make Angular more modular the Angular team has split the angular library to many smaller chunks.
each "chunk" has important role in the angular pazzle.

As writen in <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/npm-packages.html#!#dependencies">angular.io site</a>
The dependencies section contains:

#### The Features part is the most important one:

Do not worry, we will talk about everyone of them during the tutorial, but now, let's install them, and by saying install i actually mean download  them, and we will do it with npm.
<br>
If you use VSCode editor (as I'm) go to the top menu bar -->View ---> Integrated Terminal or simply press Ctrl + `

This will open a terminal box at the bottom of the edtior:
