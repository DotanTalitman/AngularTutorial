<br>
As I mentioned , this tutorial will guide you from zero , you will not download or clone some boilerplate or any other pre made code ,so you wiil be able to realy understand the basic concepts and the idea behind angular.

# NPM

Node.js and npm are essential to Angular development.<br>
npm is short for Node Package Manager and it have two major roles:
1. it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects.
2. it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

### We will use npm alot and actually this is a very common tool  that developers use in everyday code!
In order to use npm you must install node.js on your computer: 
<br>
https://nodejs.org/en/ 
<br>
You can learn about node js and npm in many places over the internet like here for example :
<br>
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
<br>
For developing angular applications you will not need to understand node.js  so don't worry, just install it on your computer so you be able to use npm.

<br>
For now we will use npm only for downloading the libraries(packages)  that we need for our project.
<br>
Later we will use another powerful tools of npm !
